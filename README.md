# VisGuide

## Abstract
Data stories are an increasingly popular means of representing and organizing observations and patterns extracted from raw data. 
Previous work proposed the use of visualization sequences to represent data stories, using heuristics to automatically arrange charts 
in a meaningful order. While this approach performs well in specific scenarios, however, it does not customize the generated sequences 
to individual users' preferences, and thus is limited both in the diversity and the flexibility of its output. Additionally, most of the 
existing automatic-generation methods arrange charts with a linear or tile layout, which cannot effectively present the relation among 
charts, and thus require considerable effort from users seeking to grasp the overall context represented collectively by multiple charts. 
Accordingly, this study proposes VisGuide: an intelligent, assistive data-story generation tool that helps users create coherent data 
stories by recommending meaningful charts tailored to each user's data-exploration preferences. It incorporates a novel tree layout 
(ViStory Tree) that shows charts' interrelationships more clearly than prior layouts can, and a mechanism capable of interactively learning 
users' preferences and interests, and adaptively recommending charts accordingly. We conducted two user studies to evaluate the visual 
design and usability of our system, and satisfaction with its recommendation system and the data stories it yielded. Those studies' 
results indicate that VisGuide can efficiently help users create coherent, personalized data stories by simultaneously and intuitively 
supporting story presentation and chart organization.
